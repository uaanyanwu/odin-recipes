# odin-recipes
This is the first project of the Odin Project demonstrating my skills in using HTML
This basic recipe website will have 3 different recipes from Igbo culture,
demonstrating the ingredients and steps necessary to make each meal
In the future, once I develop more skills in the Odin Project, I hope to revisit
this project and develop it further using CSS and JavaScript as I learn more.
